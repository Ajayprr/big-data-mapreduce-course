MSIS 2696BD Big Data Modeling and Analysis
Today, more than 80% of useful data is unstructured while same was just 
less than 10% ten years back. How did this happen? Businesses ,governments 
and all organizations now wants to store, process and analyze these huge 
datasets economically and predictably to solve numerous problems - find 
new markets, reduce risks, improve healthcare and many such applications. 
Today’s useful data has velocity, variety and volume. Old SQL databases 
are not fit to handle the new requirements. Term “ Big Data” was coined 
to solve the emerging problem. This course is about Big Data and its role 
in carrying out modern business intelligence for actionable insight to 
address new business need in the IT ( Internet of Things ) world. This 
is a lab led and open source software rooted course. Students will learn 
the fundamentals of Hadoop framework. NoSQL databases and R language. 
The class will focus on storage, process and analysis aspects. Students 
will have access to a MapR Hadoop image. The image is enhanced by instructor 
to include MongoDB and R. Prerequisites: MSIS 2601, and MSIS 2603.

Assignment 1: Due 6:00pm January 13, 2015
Run word count using MapReduce/Hadoop: 

Assignment 2: Due 6:00pm January 20, 2015
Given a set of (URL, frequency), find a unique set of URLs by designing and 
implementing MapReduce algorithm. If the input has ("URL-1", 2), ("URL-1", 3), 
and ("URL-1", 4), then the output will be ("URL-1", 9).

Assignment 3: Due 6:00pm January 29, 2015
Given a set of (URL, frequency), find Top-10 URLs (frequency of these URLs
must be the top-10 -- in descending order -- for all given URLs) by designing 
and implementing MapReduce algorithm.
